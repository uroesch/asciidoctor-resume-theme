This is a theme for formating a structured document such as a resume or CV
(curriculum vitae). I used it to get a job and it obviously working as
I still have one :).

Currently there are a few very simple color schemes available namely:

* Red
* Orange
* Green
* Purple
* Dark Purple
* Light Blue

== How to write

There are two special rules for writing with this stylesheet. The first is to
list personal information in a concise way the second is for the employment 
history.

=== Personal details, eduction and skills sections

A description list is used with the modified `[horizontal]` style to render as a 
table. The sytle modification is to space out the first column with a fixed width 
to align the output among the sections.

==== Sample 

.Asciidoctor code
[source]
----
== Personal Details
[horizontal]
Name:: Bilbo Baggins
Date of Birth:: December 25. 1996
Nationality:: New Zealand
Address:: Hobbit Avenue 9, Hobbiton
Email:: bilbo.baggins@middle.earth
Telephone:: +123 234 23 33
Mobile:: +123 432 32 33
----

=== Employment history section


The employment history section also uses description lists but requires
`role=expenrience` to be defined to render correctly. An unnumbered list
within the description list is rendered without bullets as the sample
below shows. 

.Asciidoctor code
[source]
----
== Employment History

=== 01/2011~ -- Mines of Moria
[horizontal,role="experience"]
Title:: Mithril Quality Assurance

* Synergy seeker.
